Description: The PeCorA package detects quantitative disagreements between 
    peptides mapped to the same protein. It initially format the output of 
    proteomics processing tools such as MaxQuant into an adecuate format for
    the PeCorA algorithm. This algorithm fits linear models to assess whether
    the slope of a peptideâ€™s change across treatment groups differs from the 
    slope of all other peptides assigned to the same protein. Finally, 
    visualization tools are provided to explore resulting discordant peptides,
    including boxplots.
